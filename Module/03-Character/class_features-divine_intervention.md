At 10th level a cleric may call on their deity to intervene on their behalf. It requires they use an action to describe the assistance they are seeking.

**Success = Cleric Level â‰¥ 1d100** {.text-center} 

The DM decides how the deity intervenes and the effect it may have. 

Once this feature has been used it cannot be attempted again for 7 days, otherwise it can be used again after a [long rest](rest).

At 20th level, the request automatically succeeds.
