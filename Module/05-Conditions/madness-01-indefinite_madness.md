| 01 15 | Being drunk keeps me sane.                                                                                    |
| 16 25 | I keep whatever I find.                                                                                       |
| 26 30 | I try to be like someone I know, their style of dress, mannerisms, and name.                                  |
| 31 35 | I bend the truth, exaggerate, or outright lie to be interesting to other people.                              |
| 36 45 | My goals are the only thing of interest to me, and I'll ignore everything else.                               |
| 46 50 | I find it hard to care about anything that goes on around me.                                                 |
| 51 55 | I don't like the way people judge me all the time.                                                            |
| 56 70 | I am the smartest, wisest, strongest, fastest, most beautiful person I know.                                  |
| 71 80 | Powerful enemies are hunting me, and their agents are everywhere. I am sure they're watching me all the time. |
| 81 85 | There's only one person I can trust. And only I can see this special friend.                                  |
| 86 95 | I can't take anything seriously. The more serious it is, the funnier I find it.                               |
| 96 100 | I really like killing people.                                                                                |
