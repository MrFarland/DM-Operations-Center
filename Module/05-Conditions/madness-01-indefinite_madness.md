| 01-15 | Being drunk keeps me sane.                                                                                    |
| 16-25 | I keep whatever I find.                                                                                       |
| 26-30 | I try to be like someone I know, their style of dress, mannerisms, and name.                                  |
| 31-35 | I bend the truth, exaggerate, or outright lie to be interesting to other people.                              |
| 36-45 | My goals are the only thing of interest to me, and I'll ignore everything else.                               |
| 46-50 | I find it hard to care about anything that goes on around me.                                                 |
| 51-55 | I don't like the way people judge me all the time.                                                            |
| 56-70 | I am the smartest, wisest, strongest, fastest, most beautiful person I know.                                  |
| 71-80 | Powerful enemies are hunting me, and their agents are everywhere. I am sure they're watching me all the time. |
| 81-85 | There's only one person I can trust. And only I can see this special friend.                                  |
| 86-95 | I can't take anything seriously. The more serious it is, the funnier I find it.                               |
| 96-100 | I really like killing people.                                                                                |
