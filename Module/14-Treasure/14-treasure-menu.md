The vision for this section includes the following features:

- **Book Generator**. Create random books for your characters to find in shops, libraries, in an arcanist's study.
- **Loot Generator**. A simple generator to quickly populate a found backpack, a desk, assorted crates, a noble's pockets.
- **Spellbook Generator**. A randomly generated spellbook based on the owner's level and preferred school of magic.
